## Inspiration

The Green Man was dreamed and schemed up over beers at the Bike Bar in Ithaca, as a gravel grinder and all road machine for a good friend of mine. The actual concept of “the Green Man” came from a deep connection to the outdoors, and the heart of a bicycle as a tool to experience and connect with the natural environment.

### Design brief

The Green Man is a gravel specific build. It will fit 650b x 47mm tires, has three bottle mounts (seat tube and both sides of the downtube), and rack mounts if a rear pannier rack is desired. Flat mount disc brake and through axel rear dropouts will keep things stiff and future proof. The steel gravel fork from Brother Cycles, has triple cage mounts and can do darn near any kind of packing you can dream up.

### Fit and geometry

Four numbers establish your touchpoints around the bicycle. These measurements are the starting point for what makes a bicycle custom. From this starting place we can make educated decisions about the geometry of the bicycle in conjunction with the needs of the rider. 

#### Custom measurments

|                Span                | Distance in mm |
|:------------                        |:------        |
| A - Saddle Height                  | 720            |
| B - Saddle Setback                 | 58             |
| C - Reach - BB to Handlebar        | 460            |
| D - Stack Height - BB to Handlebar | 680            |

#### Frame geometry

| Span                 | Distance in mm |
|:----------           |:------         |
| A - ST length        | 510            |
| B - TT length        | 506            |
| C - HT length        | 170            |
| D - HT angle         | 71             |
| E - ST angle         | 73             |
| F - Chainstay length | 420            |
